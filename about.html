    <h2>The medical field can be rough, but your skin doesn't have to be! For the past 8 years I have been in the medical field working as 
      an EMT and Surgical Technologist. I have always hated how dry my hands get from wearing gloves and constantly washing my hands
      all day. That's why I decided to make skin care products specifically formulated for health care workers. All of the products 
      I make at Red Llama are made with all natural oils and butters, cosmetic grade fragrance and essential oils, and all natural colorants.
      All of our products are made with plant based materials, and are vegan friendly, kosher friendly, and cruelty free! You can rest 
      assured that the products you buy from Red Llama are made with consistancy and lots of care. I hope to hear from you soon 
      and I genuinely look forward to serving you! 
      

       I hope to hear from you soon 
         and I genuinely look forward to serving you!</h2>
